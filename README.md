# Investment Web Site Project
Investment web application - SI 664 Personal Project

In this project I will develop a database-backed web site using Django.

## Project Specifications

- The project must be a web site that can be accessed and viewed.
- The project must have at least six data models (i.e. tables)
- The project must have at least three Many-to-One relationships between models and at least one Many-to-Many relationship
- The project must have a feature for end-users to log in. This can be using the internal Django authorization with manually created accounts or use a social login from one or more of the common providers (Github, Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc).
- The project must have at least one example of data coming into the site from users. This could be as simple as a comment or ranking capability or you could build a completely social site intended to be built by the crowd.
- The project is intended to have a nice graphic design - it does not have to be stunning but it also not be default browser with Times New Roman font on a white background
